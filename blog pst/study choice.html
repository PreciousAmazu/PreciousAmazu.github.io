                <h1>Study Choice Activities</h1>
                <p>I started by participating in a one month code camp on HTML, CSS and Javascript in 2021 to be sure that this was what I wanted. I further checked the course content offered in the ICT programme and they aligned with my interest. I am currently enrolled in a web development training to prepare myself.</p>

                <h1>Study motivation</h1>
                <p>I have always loved playing with computers and softwares since I was little. My first practical programming contact was during a code camp where I learnt to write HTML, CSS and JavaScript Codes after which I was convinced that pursuing a degree in Information and Communication Technology was the best for me. I believe that the courses offered as part of the modules in HZ University of Applied Sciences cover my fields on interest while learning about some other specialisations. </p>

                <h1>Plans after completing studies </h1>
                <p>After graduating from my bachelors program, I would love to pursue a master's degree before picking up a role in the industry. I am interested in a developer role reasons being that this area has always been of interest to me and I look forward to improving my knowledge here. Also, I expect to learn other courses that would give me insights to other specialisations which is helpful when working as a web developer in a team. I expect to be taught some soft skills that would prepare me for a good academic phase and for my next steps after studies.</p>
