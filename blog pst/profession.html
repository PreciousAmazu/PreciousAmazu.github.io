                        <p>With a user-centric approach that fuels productivity and increases revenue, they innovate in the intersection of form and function, of beauty and practicality.
                            By providing flexible and scalable solutions, they empower our clients to keep dreaming big and never stop revolutionizing the digital world.
                            When they are not creating and innovating, they take a step back and get to know each other more and more over a cup of coffee or a game of pool.
                            Lizard Global is a place where colleagues are friends who challenge each other’s strengths and complement each other’s imperfections. It has created a perfectly balanced work culture, which has become an indispensable part of what drives us to continuously innovate and create beautiful things.

                        <p>BusyMachines is a company that values individuality and provides an environment where everyone can express their opinions, relate their sorrows, and influence company culture. They encourage self development & strive to make the workplace a great place to learn. They have an internal library and stay up to date by reading books, blogs, organizing Knowledge-sharing events and experimenting with new tech. Also, they’re a flat company with minimal management approach and horizontal company structure. They’re delivery-oriented and guided by a strong sense of personal responsibility.</p>

                <p>I like this company because it has more IT roles, over 50 professionals and their technologies are also vast. </p>
