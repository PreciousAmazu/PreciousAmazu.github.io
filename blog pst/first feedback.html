                Hi Amazu, <br>

                I already replied to your request for a conversation which hopefully has not ended up in your spam mail. Welcome to our program. Nice to read you already have some experience through code camp which is a great start on what to expect in your first PCO course.

                Your motivation for our program is you expect it to cover your field of interest but there is a difference in enjoying working with computers and having ICT as your future job. I am just curious what about IT interest you so? what do you like about it? The answers might help you to tune into your intrinsic motivation and have more study succes when things get slightly more challenging.

                We will help you with asking questions. You just need to remind yourself that you are here to learn and obtain your degree. In order to achieve that you need knowlegde by asking questions no matter what others might or might not think about your question. Usually others are very glad someone asks what they wanted to ask too :-)

                I do not know if most of you questions got answered during the information session. But the learning structure is basically the first quartile having instructions, a web environment to obtain knowledge, watch video's apply and practice. There will be older years class assistents that can help you later on. You will also have to start working in projects and teams of up to 6 members per group. We do not use a lot of books. Most of the materials are online and we have all kinds of tools an platforms in place where you can get information. 

                You will get specilisation information through information workshops and a conference. So doing research and asking questions to obtain knowledge is needed.

                I hope that answers your questions, otherwise you can always join our next information session on the first of July or aks them in our forum! <br>

                Kind regards,<br>

                Daphne
