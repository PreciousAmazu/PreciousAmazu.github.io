      <h1>EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES</h1>
      <p>I  plan to take up a student job alongside my studies. I love reading during my spare time. 
        Reading is already something that is required while studying so it would not be difficult for me to combine both. As for working while studying, I would create a schedule for myself, and ensure that this does not conflict with my academic work.   </p>
